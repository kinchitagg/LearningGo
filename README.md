# Go Projects Repository

This repository contains multiple small Go projects as part of my journey to learn Golang. Each project is organized in a separate folder, and I will keep adding more projects to this repository as I continue my learning process.

## Projects Included

### ### [Booking CLI App](./bookingApp)

The Booking CLI App is a simple command-line application that allows users to book tickets. It has a limit on the number of available tickets and prompts the user for basic details before booking the tickets. The app is designed to demonstrate basic command-line interaction and input handling in Go.

### [Go Wiki - Simple Web Server Project](./wiki-web-server)

The Go Wiki project is a basic web server that serves wiki pages. Users can view existing wiki pages and create new pages by providing a title. If a page does not exist, the server will create a new page with the given title. Users can then edit the page and save its content. This project aims to teach web server development in Go, including HTTP request handling and response rendering.

## Usage

Each project is organized in its own folder within this repository. You can navigate to each project's folder to find more details about the specific project and how to run it.

## How to Contribute

As I continue my Golang learning journey, I plan to add more small projects to this repository. If you would like to contribute or suggest improvements to any of the existing projects, feel free to submit a pull request. Additionally, if you have any ideas for new projects that could be helpful for learning Go, I would be happy to hear them!

Let's learn Golang together and build some exciting projects! Happy coding!
